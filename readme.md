Advanced Tabs for Aseprite​​​​​​​​

Tired of juggling dozens of tabs in Aseprite? Are your complex projects turning into a chaotic mess of files? Stop fighting your tools and start creating.

Advanced Tabs is the professional project navigator you've been missing. It's a powerful, dockable side panel that replaces the standard file tabs with a feature-rich vertical list, completely transforming how you manage your projects.
Powerful Organization

Stay focused by organizing your sprites into logical, collapsible groups. Create, edit, and assign files with simple clicks.

​
Full Session Management

Save your entire workspace—all open files and their group arrangements—as a named session. Perfect for switching between multiple projects without losing your place.

Instantly switch between complex projects. Loading a session automatically closes unneeded files and opens everything you need, exactly where you left it.

❗ Requirements

ATTENTION: This extension uses a small external script to safely handle deleting session files, which prevents data corruption caused by limitations in Aseprite's scripting environment.

    Aseprite v1.3+ (tested on 1.3.15)

    Python 3.x is required for session deleting and must be installed on your system and accessible from your command line. (Most macOS and Linux systems have it pre-installed. Windows users can download it from the official Python website.)
